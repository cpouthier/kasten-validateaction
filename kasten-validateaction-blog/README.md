## Overview

In the world of Kubernetes, ensuring the integrity of backup data is crucial for maintaining application reliability. The `kasten-validateaction` script automates the validation of the latest Kasten RestorePoint in a Kubernetes cluster. This script simplifies the process of verifying backup data and metadata, allowing users to focus on their applications rather than the intricacies of backup management.

## Features

The `kasten-validateaction` script comes packed with features designed to enhance user experience:

- **Namespace Listing**: Automatically lists all available namespaces in the cluster.
- **Latest RestorePoint Detection**: Identifies the most recent RestorePoint without manual input.
- **Customizable Verification**: Prompts users to specify the percentage of data to verify, allowing for tailored validation.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Creates and monitors a `ValidateAction`, providing updates until completion.
- **Detailed Results Display**: Outputs comprehensive validation results, including phase, per-volume statistics, and any errors encountered.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Deletes the `ValidateAction` upon successful validation, keeping the environment tidy.

## Usage Instructions

To use the `kasten-validateaction` script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary components installed:
   - `kubectl`: Configured and authenticated with your Kubernetes cluster.
   - `jq`: For parsing JSON output.
   - `column`: For displaying clean, aligned tables.
   - Kasten K10: Installed in your cluster.

2. Make the script executable and run it:
   ```
   chmod +x validateaction.sh
   ./validateaction.sh
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to select a namespace, specify the RestorePoint, and choose the percentage of files to verify.

### Example Output

Upon successful execution, the script will display output similar to the following:

```

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| `jq: command not found` | jq not installed | Install with `apt install jq` or `brew install jq` |
| `No RestorePoint found` | No backups exist for the namespace | Run a backup first |
| ValidateAction stays in Running | Large data set or slow cluster | Wait longer or increase polling interval |
| CRDs not found | Kasten K10 not installed or not ready | Verify `kubectl get crds | grep kasten` |
